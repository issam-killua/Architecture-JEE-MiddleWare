> mvn compile
> mvn test 
> mvn package => generate a package thats a .jar or .war
> mvn install
> mvn deploy
> mvn site

the order matters. if u run compile it will compile,
if u run test it will compile then it will do the test (test unitaire)
if u run package it will execute the compile and test commands then it will execute the package command
and so on
